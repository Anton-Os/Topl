# Topl

An extensible rendering framework in the making, using OpenGL 4 and DirectX 11 as graphics backends. Windows is supported with a Linux port in progress.

The Rasteron submodule is required for loading textures, get the latest version on git. CMake handles Eigen, GLEW, and DirectX SDK as external project dependencies. I have tried to keep dependencies to an absolute minimum.

See BUILDING.md for building instructions
