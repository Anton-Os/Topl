# Topl-Skeleton

Skeleton code for a small renderer, using OpenGL 4 and Direct X 11. Windows is supported with a Linux port in progress.

CMake handles Eigen, GLEW, and DirectX SDK as external project dependencies. The Rasteron submodule is required for loading textures.

A more robust version of this repository is currently underway. Adds 3rd party libraries and the work will continue from here: https://github.com/Anton-Os/Topl.git
